Intro

Because my english is very bad, easiest way will  be if you copy row by row in your shell and examine output.

----------

By default, tail will print the last 10 lines of each file to standard output
$ tail .bash_profile

To print last NUM of bytes use
$ tail -c 70 .bash_profile

-n argument will print last NUM of lines instead of 10
$ tail -n 4 .bash_profile

To output header name of the file use -v or --verbose
$ tail -v -c 100 .bash_profile

To watch how new strings are added to file and show that dinamically use -f argument
$ tail -f /var/log/messages
